# uml-spring-state-machine
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joergi/uml-spring-state-machine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joergi/uml-spring-state-machine)

Two working Spring-State-Machines based only on loading two different UMLs   


The complete state-machine is defined by the url diagrames which can be found at [src/main/resources/papyrus](src/main/resources/papyrus) and can be viewed / edited with [Papyrus (Open-Source IDE for UML)](https://eclipse.org/papyrus/)

A helper for how to code with the Papyrus UML can be found at this [documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-statemachine/docs/1.2.6.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#sm-papyrus-beanref).    



(one not working example is in the [not_working_exapmle_with_2_stateMachines_in_one_diagram](https://github.com/joergi/uml-spring-state-machine/tree/not_working_exapmle_with_2_stateMachines_in_one_diagram)  branch, it will be hopefully fixed sooner or later)
