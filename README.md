# uml-spring-state-machine

A (not yet working) Spring-State-Machine based only on loading the UML.   

The complete state-machine is defined by the url diagrames which can be found at [src/main/resources/papyrus](src/main/resources/papyrus) and can be viewed / edited with [Papyrus (Open-Source IDE for UML)](https://eclipse.org/papyrus/)

A helper for how to code with the Papyrus UML can be found at this [documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-statemachine/docs/1.2.6.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#sm-papyrus-beanref).
